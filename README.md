Chat Application
=================

My own implementation of a chat app to have a better understanding of the intricacies of setting one up

Current todo:

1. get onClicks getting the data from the element
2. so can see a friend in the friends tab and then can get click and get message history and send messages

How continue:

- once have messaging then can show when have unread messages from friends

Rooms:
Make show rooms page(with create new room feautre) and a join rooms page like addFriends

*style and clean up get friends function


Extra:
*Add in a search feature for add friends and rooms so not dispaly all to the user at once
