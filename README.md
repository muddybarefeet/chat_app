Chat Application
=================

My own implementation of a chat app to have a better understanding of the intricacies of setting one up

Current todo:

*show that there are unread messages in a room
*page to join rooms (see all the rooms that can be joined(public rooms not in))
*add update read messages in chat

Next week:
*make find new friends a seach bar and then add to the friends tab
*in friends have friends listed in alphabetical order
* have a sub tab on friends to see pending in and out requests(move pending tab)


Extra:
*Add in a search feature for add friends and rooms so not dispaly all to the user at once
*add in reject friend request (have route but not hooked up or tested)
*add invite users and a respecive search route for that
  *have in create a room and in room itself can add a new user to a room
